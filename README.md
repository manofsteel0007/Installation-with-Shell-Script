# Script Usage Guide

**Download the script**

    sudo chmod +x main.sh
    sudo ./main.sh #(add letter corresponding to the software you want with spacing)

**Postgresql - a**

    sudo service postgresql status

returns active 

**MariaDB - b**

During this installation you'll be prompted to set the MySQL root password. If you are not prompted, you'll have to initialize the MySQL server setup yourself. You can do that by running the command

    mysql_secure_installation

It is really important that you remember this password, since it'll be useful later on.
